# Story 13.6: Cross-Repository Agents

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a **developer**, I want **to spawn agents that work across multiple repos**, so that **cross-repo tasks are automated**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1**: Agent can access multiple repos
2. **AC2**: Agent maintains context across repos
3. **AC3**: Coordinate parallel work in different repos
4. **AC4**: `orchestrate spawn cross-repo-developer --repos <list> --task <task>`

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Multi-repo agent context
- [ ] Task 2: Parallel coordination
- [ ] Task 3: CLI command
- [ ] Task 4: Write tests
