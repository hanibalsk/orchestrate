# Story 15.2: Anomaly Detection

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a **SRE**, I want **to detect anomalies in metrics and logs**, so that **issues are found before they become outages**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1**: Monitor error rate thresholds
2. **AC2**: Detect latency spikes
3. **AC3**: Detect memory/CPU anomalies
4. **AC4**: Detect unusual log patterns
5. **AC5**: Statistical anomaly detection (moving average, std dev)
6. **AC6**: `orchestrate incident detect --enable`

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Threshold monitoring
- [ ] Task 2: Statistical detection
- [ ] Task 3: Log pattern analysis
- [ ] Task 4: CLI command
- [ ] Task 5: Write tests
